#### Gulp Tasks

- `gulp` the default task that builds everything
- `gulp dev` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made.

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.
Run `npm install gulp gulp-dev -g` to install gulp globally.
