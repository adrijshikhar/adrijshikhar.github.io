				I try to make the most out of my time by exploring the latest
				technological advancements. Apart from being a tech enthusiast, I enjoy
				most of my time playing guitar. I have an OCD for music and love to have
				a sorted music library.

			<p className="para-content">
				When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi genre movies and
				television shows and a large amount of my free time exploring new
				advancements in every field. Some of my time is invested in learning how
				our brain functions.
