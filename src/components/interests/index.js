          I try to make the most out of my time by exploring the latest
          technological advancements. Apart from being a tech enthusiast, I
          enjoy most of my time playing guitar. I have an OCD for music and love
          to have a sorted music library.

          When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi genre movies and
          television shows and a large amount of my free time exploring new
          advancements in every field. Some of my time is invested in learning
          how our brain functions.
